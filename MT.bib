We obtain the low energy effective model describing the spin degree of freedom. We study the resulting model within the Schwinger boson and Schwinger fermion approaches. The Schwinger boson approach gives the boundary between the spin liquid phase and the magnetically ordered phases, Neel order and incommensurate Neel order. We find that increasing the strength of the spin orbit coupling, narrows the width of the spin liquid region. The Schwinger fermion approach sheds further light on the nature of the spin liquid phase. We obtain three different candidates for the spin liquid phase within the mean field approximation which are gapless spin liquid, topological Mott insulator, and the chiral spin liquid phases. We argue that the gauge fluctuations and the instanton effect may suppress the first two spin liquids, while the chiral spin liquid is stable against gauge fluctuations due to its nontrivial topology.},

We then discuss the simulation algorithm used and compare simulation results with exact results for 6-site chains to test the reliability of the approach. We present results for thermodynamic properties and correlation functions for lattices up to 8×8 in spatial size. The system is found to be an antiferromagnetic insulator for all values of the coupling constant at zero temperature in the half-filled-band case, but the long-range order is much smaller than predicted by mean-field theory. We perform a finite-size-scaling analysis to determine the character of the transition at zero coupling. For non-half-filled-band cases, our results suggest that the system is always paramagnetic, in contradiction with Hartree-Fock predictions.

abstract = {Spin-orbit (SO) coupling is the crucial parameter to drive topological insulating phases in electronic band models. In particular, the generic emergence of SO coupling involves the Rashba term which fully breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry. As soon as interactions are taken into account, however, many theoretical studies have to content themselves with the analysis of a simplified U(1) conserving SO term without Rashba coupling. We intend to fill this gap by studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard (KMH) model in the presence of Rashba SO coupling and present the first systematic analysis of the effect of Rashba SO coupling in a correlated two-dimensional topological insulator. We apply the variational cluster approach (VCA) to determine the interacting phase diagram by computing local density of states, magnetization, single particle spectral function, and edge states. Preceded by a detailed VCA analysis of the KMH model in the presence of U(1) conserving SO coupling, we find that the additional Rashba SO coupling drives new electronic phases such as a metallic regime and a direct-gap only topological insulating phase which persist in the presence of interactions.},

Using suitable projection operators and a generalized time-dependent canonical transformation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian which describes two different regimes. First, for a wide range of non-resonant frequencies, we find a change of the bilinear Heisen-berg exchange J ex that is analogous to the single-orbital case. Moreover we demonstrate that also the additional biquadratic exchange interaction B ex can be enhanced, reduced and even change sign depending on the electric field. Second, for special driving frequencies, we demonstrate a novel spin-charge coupling phenomenon enabling coherent transfer between spin and charge degrees of freedom of doubly ionized states.

To illustrate their rich physics and utility, we consider bulk Mn2Au with the two spin sublattices forming inversion partners, and a 2D square-lattice antiferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modeled by a Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

abstract = {Antiferromagnets (AFMs) exhibit intrinsic magnetization when the order parameter spatially varies. This intrinsic spin is present even at equilibrium and can be interpreted as a twisting of the homogeneous AFM into a state with a finite spin. Because magnetic moments couple directly to external magnetic fields, the intrinsic magnetization can alter the dynamics of antiferromagnetic textures under such influence. Starting from the discrete Heisenberg model, we derive the continuum limit of the free energy of AFMs in the exchange approximation and explicitly rederive that the spatial variation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter is associated with an intrinsic magnetization density. We calculate the magnetization profile of a domain wall and discuss how the intrinsic magnetization reacts to external forces. We show conclusively, both analytically and numerically, that a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field can move and control the position of domain walls in AFMs. By comparing our model to a commonly used alternative parametrization procedure for the continuum fields, we show that the physical interpretations of these fields depend critically on the choice of parametrization procedure for the discrete-to-continuous transition. This can explain why a significant amount of recent studies of the dynamics of AFMs, including effective models that describe the motion of antiferromagnetic domain walls, have neglected the intrinsic spin of the textured order parameter.},

Therefore, ultrafast control of Jex holds the promise to control spins on ultimately fast timescales. We demonstrate that time-periodic modulation of the electronic structure by electric fields can be used to reversibly control Jex on ultrafast timescales in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators. In the regime of weak driving strength, we find that Jex can be enhanced and reduced for frequencies below and above the Mott gap, respectively. Moreover, for strong driving strength, even the sign of Jex can be reversed and we show that this causes time reversal of the associated quantum spin dynamics. These results suggest wide applications, not only to control magnetism in condensed matter systems, for example, via the excitation of spin resonances, but also to assess fundamental questions concerning the reversibility of the quantum many-body dynamics in cold atom systems.},

The resulting effective magnetic field is inversely proportional to the impurity scattering rate and can reach the amplitude of a few Tesla in the systems like Co/Pt bilayers. We showthat the total light-induced effective magnetic field in ferromagnetic systems is the sum of two contributions: a helicity dependent term, which is an even function of magnetization, and a helicity independent term, which is an odd function of magnetization.

The heating process was investigated for the influence of the voltage pulse width, junction area and lead volume looking at the required write power density. The possibilities to control and reduce the write power density are described. The most promising solution to optimize the heating process and reduce the power consumption is to insert two thermal barrier layers at both ends of the MTJ layer stack, between the junction and the electrical leads, using low thermal conductivity materials.

abstract = {Recent observations of topological spin textures brought spintronics one step closer to new magnetic memories. Nevertheless, the existence of skyrmions, as well as their stabilization, require very specific intrinsic magnetic properties which are usually fixed in magnets. Here we address the possibility to dynamically control their intrinsic magnetic interactions by varying the strength of a high-frequency laser field. It is shown that drastic changes can be induced in the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the latter can even be reversed to become ferromagnetic, provided the direct exchange is already non-negligible in equilibrium as predicted, for example, in Si doped with C, Sn or Pb adatoms. In the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this enables to tune features of ferromagnetic skyrmions such as their radius, making them easier to stabilize. Alternatively, such topological spin textures can also occur in frustrated triangular lattices. Then we demonstrate that a high-frequency laser field can induce dynamical frustration in antiferromagnets, where the degree of frustration can subsequently be tuned suitably to drive the material toward skyrmionic phases.},

abstract = {Starting from the symmetry aspects and tight-binding method in combination with first-principles calculation, we systematically derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian involving spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for silicene, which is very general because this Hamiltonian applies to not only the silicene itself but also the low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn, as well as graphene when the structure returns to the planar geometry. The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the effective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and establishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic intrinsic SOC strength {\$}\backslashxi{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}, while such leading order contribution of SOC vanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger gap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled geometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is the structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in low-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature regime. In addition, the Rashba SOC in silicene is intrinsic due to its own low-buckled geometry, which vanishes at Dirac point {\$}K{\$}, while has nonzero value with {\$}\backslashvec{\{}k{\}}{\$} deviation from the {\$}K{\$} point.

We discuss the implications of our results for H′ on theories of high-temperature superconductivity.},

We use an unbiased pseudofermion functional renormalization-group method to compute the magnetic susceptibility and to determine the ordered and disordered states of the model. Aside from antiferromagnetic-, collinear-, and spiral-order domains, we find a large paramagnetic region at intermediate J 2 coupling. For larger J 2 within this domain, we find a strong tendency for staggered dimer ordering, while the remaining paramagnetic regime for low J 2 shows only weak plaquette and staggered dimer responses. We suggest this regime to be a promising region for looking for quantum spin-liquid states when charge fluctuations would be included.},

abstract = {We investigate the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with intrinsic spin orbit interactions as a paradigm for two-dimensional topological band insulators in the presence of interactions. Applying a combination of Hartree-Fock theory, slave-rotor techniques, and topological arguments, we show that the topological band insulating phase persists up to quite strong interactions. Then we apply the slave-rotor mean-field theory and find a Mott transition at which the charge degrees of freedom become localized on the lattice sites. The spin degrees of freedom, however, are still described by the original Kane-Mele band structure. Gauge field effects in this region play an important role. When the honeycomb layer is isolated then the spin sector becomes already unstable toward an easy plane Neel order. In contrast, if the honeycomb lattice is surrounded by extra "screening" layers with gapless spinons, then the system will support a fractionalized topological insulator phase with gapless spinons at the edges. For large interactions, we derive an effective spin Hamiltonian.},

This is shown by the Floquet formalism for the periodically driven repulsive Hubbard model with a strong-coupling expansion. A systematic derivation of the effective low-energy Hamiltonian for a spin degree of freedom reveals that the coupling constant for scalar spin chirality can become significant for a situation in which the driving frequency and the on-site interaction are comparable. This implies that the scalar chirality can be induced by circularly polarized lights, or that it can be used conversely for probing the chirality in Mott insulators as a circular dichroism.},

abstract = {We study the effects of spin orbit interactions on the low energy electronic structure of a single plane of graphene. We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two-dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed. The generation of spin current solid state systems has been a focus of intense recent interest. It has been argued that in doped semiconductors the spin orbit (SO) interaction leads to a spin Hall effect [1,2], in which a spin current flows perpendicular to an applied electric field. The spin Hall effect has been observed in GaAs [3,4]. Murakami et al. [5] have identified a class of cubic materials that are insulators, but nonetheless exhibit a finite spin Hall conductivity. Such a ''spin Hall insulator'' would be of intrinsic interest, since it would allow for spin currents to be generated without dissipation. In this Letter we show that at sufficiently low energy a single plane of graphene exhibits a quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect with an energy gap that is generated by the SO interaction. Our motivation is twofold. First, Novoselov et al. [6] have recently reported progress in the preparation of single layer graphene films. These films exhibit the expected ambipolar behavior when gated and have mobilities up to 10 4 cm 2 =V s. Thus, the detailed experimental study of graphene now appears feasible. We believe the QSH effect in graphene is observable below a low but experimentally accessible temperature. Secondly, we will show the QSH effect in graphene is different from the spin Hall effects studied for three-dimensional cubic systems in Ref. [5] because it leads to a phase which is topologically distinct from a band insulator. The QSH effect in graphene resembles the charge quantum Hall effect, and we will show that spin and charge currents can be transported in gapless edge states. As a model system, graphene thus identifies a new class of spin Hall insulator. It may provide a starting point for the search for other spin Hall insulators in two-dimensional or in layered materials with stronger SO interaction. SO effects in graphite have been known for over 40 years [7], and play a role in the formation of minority hole pockets in the graphite Fermi surface [8]. However, these effects have largely been ignored because they are predicted to be quite small and they are overwhelmed by the larger effect of coupling between the graphene planes. Unlike graphite which has a finite Fermi surface, however, graphene is in a critical electronic state which can be strongly affected by small perturbations at low energy. Graphene consists of a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms with two sublattices. The states near the Fermi energy are orbitals residing near the K and K 0 points at opposite corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. An effective mass model can be developed [9] by writing the low energy electronic wavefunctions as r  u AK ; u BK ; u AK 0 ; u BK 0  r (1) where u A;BK;K 0  r describe basis states at momentum k  K, K 0 centered on atoms of the A, B sublattice. r is a four component slowly varying envelope function. The effective mass Hamiltonian then takes the form, H 0  {\"{y}}i@v F y x z @ x  y @ y  : (2) Here {\~{}} and {\~{}} are Pauli matrices with z  1 describing states on the AB sublattice and z  1 describing states at the KK 0  points. This Hamiltonian describes gapless states with Eq  v F jqj. Without spin, the degeneracy at q  0 is protected by symmetry. The only possible terms that could be added to open a gap are proportional to z or z z. The z term, which corresponds to a staggered sublattice potential is odd under parity (which interchanges the A and B sublattices). The z z term is even under parity, but odd under time reversal (which interchanges K and K 0). The SO interaction allows for a new term, which will be the focus of this Letter: H SO  so y z z s z : (3) Here s z is a Pauli matrix representing the electron's spin. This term respects all of the symmetries of graphene, and will be present. Below we will explicitly construct this term from the microscopic SO interaction and estimate its magnitude.

Recent experiments on laser-induced demagnetization and spin reorientation use ultrafast lasers as a means to manipulate magnetization, accessing timescales of a picosecond or less. However, in all these cases the observed magnetic excitation is the result of optical absorption followed by a rapid temperature increase. This thermal origin of spin excitation considerably limits potential applications because the repetition frequency is limited by the cooling time. Here we demonstrate that circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses can be used to non-thermally excite and coherently control the spin dynamics in magnets by way of the inverse Faraday effect. Such a photomagnetic interaction is instantaneous and is limited in time by the pulse width (approximately 200 fs in our experiment). Our finding thus reveals an alternative mechanism of ultrafast coherent spin control, and offers prospects for applications of ultrafast lasers in magnetic devices.},
