Exploiting both spin and charge of the electron in electronic microdevices has lead to a tremendous progress in both basic
condensed-matter research and microelectronic applications, resulting in the modern field of spintronics. Current spintronics
relies primarily on ferromagnets while antiferromagnets have traditionally played only a supporting role. Recently,
antiferromagnets have been revisited as potential candidates for the key active elements in spintronic devices.
